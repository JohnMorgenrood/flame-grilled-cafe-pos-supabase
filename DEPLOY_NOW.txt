2. Navigate to your project:
   cd "C:\Users\VALERIE\Desktop\flammedgrilledcafe"

3. Login to Firebase:
   firebase login
   (This will open your browser - complete the login)

   firebase projects:list
   (Should show: flame-grilled-cafe-pos)

5. Build the project:
   npm run build
   (Wait for "Build completed" message)
