# 🚀 Payment-First Restaurant Ordering System

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a comprehensive payment-first ordering system for Flamme Grilled Cafe with the following features:

## ✅ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Error Handling & Stability**
- **ErrorBoundary.jsx**: Catches React crashes and shows user-friendly recovery options
- **Loading States**: Prevents white screens with proper loading indicators
- **Timeout Protection**: 5-second authentication timeout to prevent infinite loading

### 2. **Payment-First Order Flow**
- **PaymentModal.jsx**: Comprehensive payment interface with multiple options:
  - 💳 Credit/Debit Card input with formatting
  - 🌎 Google Pay integration
  - 💰 PayPal integration  
  - 📱 QR Code payment option
  - 🔐 Order code generation upon payment

### 3. **Order Verification System**
- **OrderCodeCard.jsx**: Delivery verification with order codes
  - 📲 Copyable order codes (e.g., FGC-7429)
  - 📊 Real-time progress tracking
  - 📞 Driver contact information
  - ✅ "I received my order" confirmation button

### 4. **Enhanced Customer Experience**
- **No Cash on Delivery**: Payment required before order processing
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time status updates with progress bars
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Customers confirm receipt with order codes

## 🔄 Order Flow

1. **Browse Menu** → Add items to cart
2. **Checkout** → Enter customer details
3. **Payment Required** → PaymentModal opens (no cash option)
4. **Payment Success** → Order confirmed with code (e.g., FGC-7429)
5. **Order Tracking** → CustomerDashboard shows OrderCodeCard
6. **Delivery** → Present order code to driver
7. **Confirmation** → Click "I received my order"

## 🎯 Technical Integration

### MobileOrderingApp.jsx
```javascript
// Payment-first order placement
const placeOrder = async () => {
  // Validation checks...
  setOrderTotal(finalTotal);
  setShowPaymentModal(true); // Show payment modal
};

// Handle successful payment
const handlePaymentSuccess = async (paymentData) => {
  // Create order with verification code
  const orderDetails = {
    orderCode: paymentData.orderCode, // Generated payment code
    paymentMethod: paymentData.method,
    status: 'confirmed'
  };
  // Navigate to tracking...
};
```

### CustomerDashboard.jsx
```javascript
// Display order verification cards
activeOrders.map(order => (
  <OrderCodeCard 
    key={order.id} 
    order={order}
    onConfirmDelivery={(orderId) => {
      toast.success('Delivery confirmed!');
    }}
  />
